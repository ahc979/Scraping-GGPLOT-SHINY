These include everything like the new battle pass, the new map changes and all the locations such as Colossal Crops, Boney Burbs, The Spire, Primal Pond, Guardian Of The Sea, Guardian Of The Bay, Guardian Of The Fields, Pond, Lake Woods, Mountain, small unnamed locations around the new map, as well as the new Tier 100 skin alongside all the new skins from the battle pass and Season 6. One cool new feature are the characters/animals that Epic implemented that include the Spire Guardian, Frog, Chicken, Boar, and Wolf. These characters allow you to purchase rifts, information on the next storm circle, and disguises from the characters with gold. The gold system from last season remains in Season 6. I also include all the weapons that are built around crafting with the new characters like mechanical rifle, mechanical shockwave and explosive bow, makeshift bow, makeshift shotgun, makeshift SMG, makeshift revolver, primal rifle, primal shotgun, primal pistol, primal submachine gun, meat, animal bones, mechanical parts, and makeshift parts. Some weapons that were vaulted include the tac shotgun, the lever action shotgun, the lever action rifle, the dragon breath shotgun, zero point crystals and abilities, suppressed smgs, it's ok because the pump shotgun is back tho. Everything I showed new in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 was in arena meaning stuff like the new animals as well as weapons will be in all modes. Oh and before I forget, I also show the new umbrella you can customize, all the new weapon wraps, skins, dances, emotes, sprays, music songs, v-bucks, banners, and everything you can possibly think of from the Battle Pass for Season 6. So, if you're looking for everything new in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 as well as all the new changes regarding weapons and features/mechanics, then this video is definitely for you. On top of that, this video will show you the new chapter 2 Season 6 map, the new locations, and everything new so you can have more fun and be more knowledgeable for the new season.

Onion rings are far better than apple rings, carrot rings, and also rings. Subscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlYhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcookinghttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookinhttp://yousuckatcooking.comBefore we get into the recipe, let's talk safety. A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. Deep Fry Safety https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safelyRecipe Slice some onions and make ringsRemove tapeYeah basically take any onion you like Add ¬æ cup of flour and ¬º cup corn starch to a bowl Then add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total Add around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. Heat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)Preferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out I see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH So use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oilAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it I highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying Place onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl When you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooledThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995Thanks! I hope you order onion rings from the bar."

She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella‚Äôs flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar¬Æ winner Emma Thompson (‚ÄúHowards End,‚Äù ‚ÄúSense & Sensibility‚Äù). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.  Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúCruella‚Äù is directed by Craig Gillespie (‚ÄúI Tonya‚Äù) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (‚ÄúFreaky Friday‚Äù), Marc Platt (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù) and Kristin Burr (‚ÄúChristopher Robin‚Äù), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Two-time Oscar¬Æ- winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Room with a View‚Äù) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own.For more information on ‚ÄúCruella,‚Äù follow us on:Facebook:        https://www.facebook.com/DisneyCruellaDeVil Twitter:             https://twitter.com/cruella  Instagram:       https://www.instagram.com/disneycruella YouTube:         https://youtube.com/disneymovietrailers‚ÄãHashtag:          #Cruella"

We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn‚Äôt want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé"

This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!Manhunt T-Shirt Details:Each and every Manhunt t-shirt purchased will be assigned a unique number. Limit 10 Manhunt t-shirts per order.In late April after all shirts have been processed, we will randomly select one unique Manhunt t-shirt number for invitation into a 2021 Dream Manhunt video. Dream will announce the associated order number (and perhaps country and initials) via social media. The lucky customer does not need to see the announcement or know their order number, because we will make reasonable attempts to contact the customer using the contact information provided at checkout. Do not fall for scams that ask you to provide sensitive information or click, install or open anything! If contact attempts are not successful or the invitation is not accepted within 2 business days, we will repeat the same process every 2 business days approximately until an invitation is accepted. The non-transferable invitation and video participation have no retail or monetary value for the purchaser of the Manhunt t-shirt which is sold at fair value and is non-refundable. Adequate computer, internet, video and other capabilities will be arranged if necessary for the sole purpose of video participation.Employees and their families are not eligible for selection.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen#MinecraftHitmen"

With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who the singer is behind the mask. The singers may attempt to throw off the crowd, but keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show.
